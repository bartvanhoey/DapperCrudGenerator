=Link to the page that lists items, which should have links 
= for adding editing and deleting. I made it match the code
= in NavMenu.cs but of course you can style links 
= however you like.

<li class="nav-item px-3">
   <NavLink class="nav-link" href="@@LISTPAGENAME" Match="NavLinkMatch.All">
      <span class="oi" aria-hidden="true"></span>@@CLASSNAME
   </NavLink>
</li>
